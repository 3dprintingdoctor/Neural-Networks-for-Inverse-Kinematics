# Neural-Networks-for-Inverse-Kinematics


### Setup

1.  Install Anaconda for Python3.5 from https://www.continuum.io/downloads
2.  Install Tensorflow from https://www.tensorflow.org/install/. Refer steps with Anaconda.
3.  Inside your activated conda environment use ```pip install keras```.

That's easy!!!
